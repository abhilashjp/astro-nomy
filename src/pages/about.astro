            Why Usage-Based Pricing?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Over the past several years, I've had the privilege of building
            products at the intersection of pricing, billing, and revenue
            management. Most recently, I led Chargebee's Usage-Based Billing
            product from the ground up—building an event streaming platform that
            enables pricing agility and flexible monetization for modern SaaS
            and AI companies.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've also worked extensively on taxation, invoicing, compliance, and
            payment systems across multiple companies. Through this work, I've
            seen firsthand how the right pricing model can transform a business,
            and how the wrong one can hold it back.
          </p>
          <p>
            Usage-based pricing is fundamentally changing how software companies
            monetize their products. But despite its growing importance, there's
            a gap in accessible, practical resources for product managers,
            founders, and business leaders trying to navigate this shift.
          </p>

            What is UsagePricing.com?
          </h3>
          <p>This site is my attempt to fill that gap. Here, I share:</p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
            <li>
              <strong class="text-foreground">Educational content</strong> on usage-based
              pricing models, strategies, and implementation
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong class="text-foreground">Practical frameworks</strong> and tools
              to help you design and optimize your pricing
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong class="text-foreground">Analysis and opinions</strong> on trends
              in SaaS monetization and billing
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong class="text-foreground">Real-world examples</strong> and case
              studies
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            My goal is to eventually compile this into a comprehensive
            resource—think of it as a practical handbook for usage-based
            pricing, similar to what deeplearningbook.org did for deep learning.
